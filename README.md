# Network Camera Viewer
A viewer for network cameras that need to use IE

This viewer uses the IE engine to hopefully allow you to view network camera live views that require IE beyond 2022 as the engine is staying in Windows until at least 2029.

Do note that you may will need to install any IE addons for your network camera before using this program.

This program requires .NET Framework 4.8 and Windows 7 or newer.
